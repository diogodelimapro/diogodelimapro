👋 Hi, I'm @diogodelimapro.
👀 I'm interested in fiction literature, comics, artificial intelligence, and primarily horror and action movies. I can talk for hours about the human mind, the use of psychedelics, religion, science fiction, movies, literature, Brazilian politics, religion, and computer science, mainly support analysis.
🌱 I'm currently learning and exploring various aspects of artificial intelligence, as it fascinates me.
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on literary projects, especially those related to fiction or artificial intelligence. I run a blog about literature and comics at www.cachorrosolitario.com.br and a website for text editing at www.acorujaeocorvo.com.br.
